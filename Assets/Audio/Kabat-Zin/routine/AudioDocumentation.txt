- Each day's routine is in seperate folders
- They are numbered with respect to their sequence:
If the file name starts with 00, that is the first
audio to be listened on that day which follows
by 01, 02, etc.
- These are not original recordings. They are edited
so that high-pitched sounds are more bass (to not
irritate CPPs). And each recording has a 7-10 second
gap.
